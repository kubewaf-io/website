This directory contains resources that help **any AI coding assistant** (Grok, Claude, GPT, Cursor, Gemini, Continue.dev, Aider, etc.) write high-quality, valid `SecRule` resources for kubeWAF.

## Quick Start for Any LLM

Copy the entire content of [kubewaf-secrule-expert](kubewaf-secrule-expert/) and paste it at the beginning of your conversation (or add it to your custom instructions / project rules).

Then simply describe what you want to block or detect in natural language.

Example prompt after loading the expert:

> "Create a rule that blocks requests coming from known bad ASNs trying to access /admin or /wp-login.php. Use anomaly scoring instead of immediate deny."

## Files

| File | Purpose | Best For |
|------|---------|----------|
| `kubewaf-secrule-expert.md` | Master portable expert instructions + examples + guardrails | **Any AI** (Claude, Cursor, Grok, GPT, etc.) – copy & paste or load as context |
| `AGENTS.md` (at repo root) | Project-level rules that many AI tools auto-detect | Cursor, Claude Code, Aider, Continue, Windsurf, etc. when working inside this repo |
| `.grok/skills/kubewaf-secrule/SKILL.md` | Native Grok skill (auto-activates on relevant requests) | Users of the Grok TUI / CLI |

## Recommended Workflow

1. **Best quality (recommended)**: Use a strong frontier model (Claude 4, GPT-4.1, Grok 4, etc.) + the expert context.
2. **When you want raw SecLang** (simpler for humans and AIs): Ask the AI to output classic ModSecurity `SecRule` syntax first, then use the included conversion helpers or `cmd/crs-converter` to turn it into a proper `SecRule` CR.
3. **Fully offline / air-gapped**: Load `kubewaf-secrule-expert.md` into a local model
   (7B–9B class or better) with the same validation step below. There is no separate
   “small model guide” yet — the expert prompt + dry-run is the supported path.

See the main guide [Writing Security Rules](/docs/security/writing-rules/#writing-rules-with-ai-assistance) for more context and examples of the AI-assisted flow.

## Validation Is Mandatory

Any AI-generated rule should be validated:

```bash
# After the AI produces a SecRule YAML file
kubectl apply -f my-rule.yaml --dry-run=server -o yaml
# or run the project's conversion logic
```

The expert instructions teach AIs to produce output that survives this check.

## Contributing Improvements

If you find that certain prompts produce bad rules, or you have great new examples/patterns, please improve `kubewaf-secrule-expert.md` and the skill. The goal is to make the "AI as SecRule co-author" experience reliable and delightful.
