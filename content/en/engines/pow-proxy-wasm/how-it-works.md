## Request path

1. **Clearance cookie** (`challenge-clearance`) present and valid  
   → continue (HMAC + expiry + optional IP bind).
2. Else **one-shot PoW cookies** (`challenge`, `challenge-sig`, `challenge-nonce`)  
   or **`challenge-token`** header JSON valid  
   → continue, and on the response mint clearance / drop solve cookies.
3. Else **issue a new challenge**: HTTP **403**, HTML solver page, signed
   challenge cookies. Browser solves, sets nonce, reloads.

There is **no POST verify endpoint**. The browser only sets cookies and reloads;
the filter verifies on the next request.

## Cryptography

| Piece | Mechanism |
|-------|-----------|
| Challenge authenticity | HMAC-SHA256 over base64url(challenge JSON payload), secret shared by all replicas |
| PoW | SHA-256(`payload_bytes ‖ BE_uint64(nonce)`) with *N* leading zero bits |
| Clearance | Fixed layout: `body.sig` where `body = base64url(exp_be64 ‖ salt16 ‖ ip)` and `sig = base64url(HMAC-SHA256(body))` (no JSON on the hot path) |

Challenge payload fields (JSON, then base64url):

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `ts` / `exp` | Issued / expiry (unix seconds) |
| `diff` | Difficulty (leading zero bits) |
| `salt` | Random salt |
| `ctx` | Optional client IP |
| `cid` | Optional Envoy `connection.id` (downstream connection bind) |

## Client page

`challenge.html` is **embedded** in the WASM binary (`/go:embed`). Single file:
no CDN, fonts, or external scripts. Sync SHA-256 in JS, system dark/light theme,
sets `challenge-nonce` on success.

## Timers and cookies

Solve window and cookie Max-Age are **aligned** so cookies cannot outlive the
signed challenge.

| Credential | Cookie(s) | Lifetime | HttpOnly | Purpose |
|------------|-----------|----------|----------|---------|
| Challenge / solve | `challenge`, `challenge-sig`, `challenge-nonce` | **60s** | No (JS must read) | One-shot PoW window |
| Clearance | `challenge-clearance` | **30 min** | **Yes** | Access after successful solve |

**Why clearance?** Replaying the raw PoW triple for half an hour would turn the
solution into a long-lived bearer token. After verify, the filter issues a
separate signed clearance cookie and **deletes** the solve cookies.

Clearance is still a **bearer cookie** (shareable until expiry). IP binding
narrows reuse; true single-use nonces need shared cluster state.

Other headers:

| Name | Role |
|------|------|
| `challenge-token` | Optional JSON solution for non-browser clients |
| `x-challenge-difficulty` | Per-request difficulty override (clamped to min/max) |
| `challenge-sig` | Response header exposing signature for non-cookie clients |
| Config `header` / `value` | Optional header injected on successful/pass-through responses |

## Client binding (IP + connection.id)

| Token | Fields | Binding |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Challenge (`ctx`, `cid`) | Client IP + Envoy `connection.id` | Same IP; same downstream connection when both sides see a connection id |
| Clearance (`ctx`) | Client IP only | Survives reload and new TCP/TLS connections |

IP resolution order: Envoy `source.address` → left-most `X-Forwarded-For` →
`X-Real-IP` → empty (skip IP binding). Strip untrusted XFF at the edge.

## Dynamic difficulty

1. Each issued challenge increments a **local** counter.  
2. On a **5s tick**, map recent issue rate → `base + {0…6}` (clamped to min/max).  
3. Publish best-effort shared value for other VMs.

Priority for a **new** challenge: `x-challenge-difficulty` header → dynamic value
→ config `base_difficulty`.

## Security model

| Guarantee | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Stateless multi-replica (shared secret only) | Yes |
| Challenge cannot be forged without secret | Yes (HMAC) |
| Browser must spend CPU for a solve | Yes (PoW) |
| Secret required at startup | Yes (fail closed) |
| Solve cookies aligned with challenge expiry | Yes (60s) |
| Long-lived credential is clearance, not raw PoW | Yes |
| Clearance not readable by page JS | Yes (HttpOnly) |
| True one-time PoW / global anti-replay | No |
| Strong client identity | No |

**Recommendations:** shared secret across replicas; combine with rate limits and
WAF; correct XFF trust at the edge.
