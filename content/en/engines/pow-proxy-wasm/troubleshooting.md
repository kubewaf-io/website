| Symptom | Check |
|---------|--------|
| Filter never loads / Envoy logs config fail | `secret` missing or &lt; 32 bytes |
| Always 403 challenge page | Cookies blocked; clock skew; IP context changed between issue and solve |
| Works then re-challenges after ~30 min | Clearance expired — expected |
| Works then re-challenges after ~60s without clearance | Clearance not set (response path); check logs for generate errors |
| Context mismatch in logs | Client IP changed (XFF vs direct); normalize hop trust |
| Too hard / too easy for users | Tune `base_difficulty` / min / max; watch dynamic tick logs |

When deployed by **kubeWAF**, also check:

- `status.challengeEnabled` / `status.challengeSecretName` on the `WAF`  
- Operator wasm serve: `/wasm/challenge-proxy-wasm.wasm` available on the operator
